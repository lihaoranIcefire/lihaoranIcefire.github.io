My name is Haoran Li (Chinese: 李浩然). I got my PhD from University of Maryland in 2024, under the supervision of [Christian K. Zickert](https://www.math.umd.edu/~zickert/). My research topic was [Polylogarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylogarithm) and their applications within number theory.
